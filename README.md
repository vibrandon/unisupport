# UniSupport – Comprehensive University Support System

## Overview

UniSupport is a centralised web application designed to improve the wellbeing of university students by providing a unified and accessible support platform. The system replaces the current fragmented services with a single solution that combines mental health, academic, and wellbeing support. UniSupport prioritises both immediate assistance and long-term preventative strategies by using student data to tailor support to individual needs.

## Problem Statement

Research indicates that up to 69 percent of university students experience mental health difficulties during their studies. These challenges stem from a range of factors including academic pressure, lifestyle changes, and social isolation. Existing university support systems are often difficult to navigate and lack real-time support options. Students must search through multiple websites and menus, which can delay or prevent them from receiving the help they need. Current services do not offer 24/7 chat-based support, and some students are reluctant to use phone-based helplines. There is also a lack of preventative features to identify and address issues early.

## Project Aim

The aim of UniSupport is to create a comprehensive wellbeing platform that improves the overall mental health and academic success of students. The system offers easy access to personalised support through a central portal, reducing barriers to seeking help. UniSupport provides students with professional matching, real-time support, and structured academic adjustment processes. It also uses surveys and wellbeing data to build tailored support strategies and enable early intervention.

## Key Features

##1. Professional Matching System – Students can be automatically matched with or manually choose a professional such as a counsellor, health coach, or academic adviser. The matching system considers individual needs and preferences, and appointments are maintained over time to ensure continuity.

2. Academic Adjustment Requests – Students can submit requests for deadline extensions and other adjustments related to their mental health. University staff can review and approve or deny these requests, with all relevant context made available to support fair decisions.

##3. Messaging System – A multi-channel communication platform includes a real-time AI chatbot for immediate support, chatrooms for peer interaction, and direct messaging with professionals. A crisis mode is triggered automatically when concerning language is detected.

##4. Student Progress Tracking – Students complete regular wellbeing assessments, and professionals record observations following meetings. This data is stored securely and used to monitor mental health trends over time.

5. Wellbeing Analytics – The system uses artificial intelligence to analyse collected data and provide students with ongoing recommendations to support their mental health and academic performance.
